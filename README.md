# CS-230-Project
Design document for 'Draw It or Lose It,' detailing architecture, memory, storage, and security for scalable multi-platform deployment.

## The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements

The Gaming Room is a company that currently has a game application, "Draw It or Lose It," designed for Android systems. The client wanted to expand this game to multiple platforms, including web-based environments that could run on various operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile devices (iOS, Android). The main requirements were to ensure that the game could support multiple teams and players simultaneously, maintain unique names for games and teams, and guarantee scalability, security, and efficient resource management.

## What I Did Well in Developing the Documentation

In developing the software design document, I excelled at clearly outlining the system architecture and integrating design patterns like Singleton and Iterator to manage the game's components effectively. I also provided detailed evaluations of different operating platforms, comparing their advantages and disadvantages, which helped in recommending a robust solution. My focus on scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and security ensured that the design could meet the client’s requirements effectively.

## How the Design Document Process Helped in Developing Code

Working through the design document helped in several ways. It allowed me to carefully plan the system’s architecture and understand how different components would interact. By mapping out the data flow and communication between client and server, I could anticipate potential issues and plan for scalability, which would be essential when translating the design into actual code. This structured approach streamlined the coding process by having clear, pre-defined guidelines.

## What I Would Revise and How I Would Improve It

If I were to revise any part of my work, I would enhance the section on distributed systems and network considerations. I would add more detail on handling connectivity issues, such as implementing fallback mechanisms or caching strategies to ensure that game data remains accessible even during network outages. These improvements would add another layer of reliability to the system.

## Interpreting the User’s Needs and Implementation

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on the requirements for scalability, cross-platform functionality, and security. By keeping these priorities at the forefront, I ensured that the software design could handle multiple concurrent users across different platforms without compromising performance or data integrity. Understanding user needs is crucial because it ensures the software will function as expected, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It also helps in designing features that are relevant and intuitive for users.

## Approach to Designing Software and Future Techniques

In designing software for "Draw It or Lose It," I approached the project by starting with a thorough analysis of the client’s requirements, followed by research on suitable platforms and technologies. I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns to structure the system efficiently. For future projects, I would continue to use this structured approach, but I would also consider incorporating more Agile methodologies, such as iterative development and continuous feedback loops, to make the design process more adaptive to changes. This would allow for a more flexible response to evolving client needs and faster iteration on software features.
